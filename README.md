# Threat Modeling Playbook
## Concept
The goal is to take a systematic approach to evaulating a system and the people that interact with it to determine how it might be compromised, either for financial gain or disruption of service. The findings from this evaulation can be used to enhance system resiliency and security.

### Questions to answer
* What are we working on?
* What can go wrong?
* How do we mitigate that?
* Did we do a good job?

### Work products
* Actor and component inventory
* Diagrams
* Bug/Issue/Threat List
* Contact List

## Diagrams
Diagrams can get overcomplicated very quickly. I've found it helpful to strictly limit the scope of a given diagram.
* Component
* Data Flow
* Process Flow

## Notes & Links
Collecting thoughts and resources to build better threat models.
